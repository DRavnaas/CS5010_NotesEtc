Module 5 - lambda, local, higher order functions, standard functions

(define (add1 x) (+ x 1))
(define  add1 (lambda (x) (+ x 1)))

These are the same

Define and local are very similar
local is used in functions, define is used outside
But it's a matter of style

Need contract and purpose for both
don't need examples, or tests (or strategy because should be very simple)

Note that lambda can't call itself easily (it has no name)

"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"
(look up y operator)
available online for free

"The little schemer"
fun and easy

"y" operator

higher order function
(define (something x)
 (lambda(y) (+ y x)))

(define add3 (something 3))
=> body -> (lambda(y) (+ y 3))
=> ie: ((lambda(y) (+ y 3)) 10) ; ie: y=10

so add3 adds something to 3
something take an input and adds it to 3
the lambda adds something to 3


((lambda(x y) (+ y x) 

(define other (lambda (x) (lambda(y) (+ x y))))

->  ((other 5) 2)
(other 5) => function that adds something to 5

ie: functions are first class objects
- give them names
- pass them
- return them
- assign their value to variables (do operations on them?)
- put them inside data structures (make a list, etc)


Calculus

df/dx = limit as deltaX goes to zero of (f(x + deltaX) - f(x))/deltaX

in scheme
(define derivative(f)
 (lambda(w)
   (/ (- (f (+ w deltaX) (f w)) deltaX)))

(simplify the limit by saying deltaX is really small (define deltaX as e to the -10th)


(define delta-x 0.00000001)
(define (derivative f)
(lambda (w)
 (/ (- (f (+ w delta-x)) (f w)) (delta-x)))

((derivative (lambda (x) (* x x x))) 4)
= 48

(((lambda(x)  
    lambda(y) (+ y x) 3) 5)

first step - get rid of first lambda by substituting in the expression and replacing all x's with 3's

-> ((lambda (y) (+ 3 y)) 5)


"check syntax" -> show stepp
shows the result of one step

next step - take expression and replace all y's with 5's

(+ 3 5)

stepper - left to right, inside out
this guarantees no infinite loop (?) lambda calculus

(don't use foldr when another standard function is available)


map:
(X -> X) ListOf<X> -> ListOf<x>
(map add1 '(1 2 3))

ormap
(X -> Boolean) ListOf<X> -> Boolean
(ormap odd? '(1 2 3))
; true
(ormap odd? '(2 4 6))
;false

andmap
(X -> Boolean) ListOf<X> -> Boolean
(andmap odd? '(1 2 3))
; false
(andmap odd? '(1 3 5))
;true

filter
(X -> Boolean) ListOf<X> -> ListOf<X>
(filter odd? '(1 2 3)) 
; '(1 3)

foldr
;; collapse a list into a single value of some type
(X Y -> Y) Y ListOf<X> -> Y
(foldr + 1 '(1 2 3))
; 7
; for the given list:
; if the list is empty, perform the operation with the given operand (eg: + 1 in the given example)
; if the list is not empty, take the first item and perform the operation against that item and the rest of the list
