Module 3 code walkthrough notes

Problem 1

1. Information Analysis
	What events should the world respond to?
	What information changes in response to an event?
	What information doesn't change in response to an event?
2. From your information analysis, write out the constant definitions and data definitions.
3. From your list of events, write a wishlist of functions to be designed
4. Design the functions on your wishlist (use the design recipe!)

Question - initial world - ok to put rectangle at center?

Info analysis:
Dimensions of canvas: constant
x pos of rectangle:  world
y pos of rectangle:  world
rectangle selected or not:  world
x pos of circle: world
y pos of circle: world
....OR mouse position = world
size of rectangle: constant

in-rectangle says whether selects or not
but then need to render without assuming x, y = new center

...or could use mouse position 


Problem #2:

1st step - copy over two draggable cats
Add heading and get tests to work
Added "stop at wall"
Added handling direction keys
Added "bounce"

To do - added shift in if dragged off campus
To do - check on arrow keys if cat not selected
To do - double check all have examples
To do - double check all have tests and test coverage = 100
To do - double check strategy

tests needed:
world-after-tick
cat-after-tick
