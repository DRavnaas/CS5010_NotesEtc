problem set #5:
=================

(from fall)

world

tree

key events

mouse events

? can selected node be dragged off screen ? 
? can you move son "above" root?

canvas = 400x400

node size is change-able by single line of code

select a node - only selects node, not sons

dragging node drags "tree" made up nodes and sons

more than one root allowed in world

t = new node
n = new son to selected node 
u = deletes all nodes in upper half of canvas
(x = node x of leftmost son + 2 * node width)
(y = node y of leftmost son + 3 * node length)
if a son wouldn't fit, turn selected node red

d deletes a node

key event: partition
"t"
"d"
"n"
"u"
everything else

mouse event: partition
"button down"
"drag"
"button up"
everything else


world: 
- likely knows mouse x,y and list of nodes
roots = list of nodes, 


node - selected (& subtree) x,y of center & bool for "no room for child" flag
hints from required provided functions:
 center = x, y, sons = list of nodes, selected  (and our "room for child" flag)


for "leftmost" son - node calls sons to figure out leftmost node
(every son returns center, then node get max of leftmost to see if next son would fit)
